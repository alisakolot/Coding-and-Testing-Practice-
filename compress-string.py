"""Write a function that compresses a string.

Repeated characters should be compressed to one character and the number of
times it repeats:

>>> compress('aabbaabb')
'a2b2a2b2'

If a character appears once, it should not be followed by a number:

>>> compress('abc')
'abc'

The function should handle letters, whitespace, and punctuation:

>>> compress('Hello, world! Cows go moooo...')
'Hel2o, world! Cows go mo4.3'
