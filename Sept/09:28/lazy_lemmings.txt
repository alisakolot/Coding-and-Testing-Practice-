1. There are num_holes, representing occupied areas in a list 
2. Each hole is one meter apart
3.  the lemming in hole #1 needs to travel 2m to hole #3
    the lemming in hole #2 needs to travel 1m to hole #3
    the lemming in hole #4 needs to travel 1m to hole #3 (or 1m to hole #5)
    the lemming in hole #6 needs to travel 1m to hole #5
4. Calculate the longest amount in metters any lemming needs to travel. 
    Return a single number for hte nax dist needed to travel

num_holes:  number of num_holes
cafe: indexes of holes with food in them, sorted list

Test 1:
num_holes = 2
cafe = [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

Test 2:
num_holes = 3
cafe = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1,0]


Test 3:
num_holes = 2
cafe = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
