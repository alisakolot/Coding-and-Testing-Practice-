1. Black circles are dead branches. There will never be two dead branches 
    in a row
2. The beginning and ending branches are alive
3. The lemur jumps from 2 to 4 and 4 to 6. She skips 3, 5
4. The list of branches is represented by a list: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
    1 is dead
5. Calculate number of jumps she needs to make


Solution Possibilities:
    A. Indexing 
    B. Linked List? (not sure about this one)

1. Indexing 
    -Given: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

        1. if the val is 1, skip 
        or if the value is 0, enumerate as you iterate over the list
        enumerate(some_list): looping over something and have an automatic counter
        2. Add a condition that would ensure that 1 is not enumerated
        3. return the last value of enumerate(some_list)

        But why enumerate? Can't we solve it without this method?
